Tips for collaborative and reproducible work:

* Use paths relative to the current directory (NEVER absolute paths).
* DO NOT commit large (> 10 MB) files.
* Write meaningful commit messages.
* Use meaningful file names (not `a.txt`, `b.txt`).
* Put a comment at the beginning of each script or notebook that briefly
  explains what's inside.
* Make small commits each time you get to a checkpoint in your work, rather
  than one large commit at the end of the day.
* Workflow: write out what you're going to do (in a text or Markdown file), do
  it, then write out what did/didn't work and what's next.
