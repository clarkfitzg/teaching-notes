# Week 5 Discussion

Reminder: OH Monday 9-10am in Shields 360

## Presentations

You'll present a status report to the class next week.

Plan to present on Tuesday (although you might not present until Thursday).

* Format: 4 minute talk, 1 minute for questions

* Audience: STA 160 students
    + So if we've talked about the data in class, you don't need to tell
      us about it again

* Purpose: What is the status of your project?
    + What are your concrete goals?
    + What specific tasks have you completed?
    + Where do you need help or feedback?

## Presentation Skills

* How you act:
    + Face the audience
    + Maintain good posture and don't cross your arms
    + Move hands or even body while speaking
    + Speak at a deliberate pace (not too slow, not too fast)
    + Don't giggle or laugh unless someone told a joke
    + Be conversational. Don't read from slides

* What you say:
    + Introduce yourselves and your project at the beginning
    + Avoid acronyms and abbreviations
    + Avoid assumptions about the audience: like, you know, as expected, ...
    + Avoid adverbs (words ending in "-ly"): very, easily, entirely, ...
    + Avoid pronouns without context: it, this
    + Think about what the "story" is for your project. What's interesting and
      important?
    * Thank the audience at the end!

* Slides
    + Don't make comparisons to previous slides
    + Support claims with evidence
    + Design visuals carefully (see [handout][])
    + Make uncluttered slides
    + Make self-contained slides
    + Use plain language
    + Plan for at least 30 seconds (probably 1 minute) per slide

### Types of Slides

* Title Slide
    + Include title and names
    + Don't forget to present this slide

* Story Slide
    + The title is the takeaway
    + Use 1-3 points on the slide to support the title

* Summary Slide
    + Summarize the main points of your talk
    + Include miniature versions of key visuals


## Let's Practice!

Get into groups of three. If possible, make sure no one else from your project
is in the group.

Take five minutes to write a two-minute presentation of your project. Think
about what you'll need to tell the others in the group.

Take turns having each person present to the group. While they present, the
others should write down thoughts. For example:

  * Did they introduce themselves and their project?
  * Are they speaking clearly?
  * Are they being vague?
  * Do you understand what they're talking about?
  * What questions do you have for the speaker?

After a speaker finishes, spend a minute or two giving them your feedback.
